        <h2>Prologue</h2>
        <h4>From 1990-Summer 2019</h4>
        <img src="./images/IMG_MOBILE.jpg" alt="Mobile Cathedral">
        <p>I come from a large Catholic family in Alabama. For as far back as I could remember, I had wanted to be a priest, and spent most of my adult life in that pursuit. It was a wonderful, but trying experience. So trying, that it led me to the difficult conclusion that I could not do it well for the rest of my life, and so it was not my true calling. I knew I needed to make a change.</p>
        <h2>Act 2</h2>
        <h4>Fall 2019</h4>
        <img src="./images/IMG_MEANDBRO.jpg" alt="Me and my brother">
        <p>After deciding to make a radical change in my life, I receive the hard sell from my brother to come move up to Boston and study coding. Now I currently live with him, his wife, his three kids (ages 7, 5, and a newborn), and their dog... It's pretty crowded</p>
